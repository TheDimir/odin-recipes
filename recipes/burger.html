        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>A great burger is not about a fancy brioche bun or homemade ketchup. It’s about achieving the ideal proportion of juicy, cheese-cloaked beef, sharp onion, crunchy lettuce, and sweet-tangy “special sauce,” wrapped in a soft toasted bun. This one nails it.</p>

        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>20 ounces ground beef, 80% lean</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons plus ½ cup mayonnaise (preferably Hellmann’s)</li>
            <li>4 potato or soft-seeded hamburger buns</li>
            <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
            <li>¼ cup sweet pickle relish</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce (such as Tapatío, Cholula, or Crystal)</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 large iceberg lettuce leaves, torn into large pieces</li>
            <li>¼ medium red onion, sliced as thinly as possible</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>

            <p>Divide beef into 4 equal pieces. Using both hands, work meat into smooth spheres, compacting very lightly.</p>
            
            <li>Step 2</li>

            <p>Place a large sheet of parchment paper, plastic wrap, or foil on your work surface. Place balls on top, spacing evenly. Place another piece of parchment (or whatever you’re using) over and press down to flatten each ball into a patty 5" in diameter.</p>
            
            <li>Step 3</li>

            <p>Peel back top sheet and use your fingertips to press a shallow, 2"-wide depression into the center of each patty. The meat will contract and push up in the center as the patties cook; making this little divot helps to keep the burgers flat.</p>
            
            <li>Step 4</li>

            <p>Season meat generously with salt. Drizzle patties with 1 Tbsp. oil, dividing evenly.</p>
            
            <li>Step 5</li>

            <p>Gently flip patties on parchment and season the other side with salt. Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil.</p>
            
            <li>Step 6</li>

            <p>Using the back of a spoon, spread 2 Tbsp. mayonnaise over both cut sides of all buns, dividing evenly and spreading all around.</p>
            
            <li>Step 7</li>

            <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-low and cook half of buns, mayonnaise side down, until golden and crisp around the edges, 2–3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and cook remaining buns; set them aside and increase heat to medium-high.</p>

            <li>Step 8</li>

            <p>Peel 2 patties off of parchment paper and press down gently into skillet, spacing evenly apart. Cook, without any touching or fussing, until edges are browned and you can see juices pooling in the center of patties, about 5 minutes.</p>

            <li>Step 9</li>

            <p>Slide a thin metal spatula, preferably a flexible one like a fish spatula, underneath patties and flip them over.</p>

            <li>Step 10</li>

            <p>Place a slice of cheese over each patty, reduce heat to medium-low, and cover skillet. Cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute.</p>

            <li>Step 11</li>

            <p>Transfer patties to a plate. Let rest about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, wipe out skillet with paper towel and repeat cooking process with remaining patties.</p>

            <li>Step 12</li>

            <p>While burgers are resting, make your secret sauce. Stir ketchup, relish, hot sauce, and remaining ½ cup mayonnaise in a small bowl to combine, then season generously with salt and pepper.</p>

            <li>Step 13</li>

            <p>Start to build your burger. Stack 2–3 pieces of lettuce on bottom halves of buns. Place several slices of onion on top of lettuce.</p>

            <li>Step 14</li>

            <p>Smear a couple of tablespoons of secret sauce on top halves of buns.</p>

            <li>Step 15</li>

            <p>Place burgers on top of onions, close burgers with top bun, and serve!</p>
