        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for work surface</li>
            <li>1 cup cold unsalted butter or cold vegetable shortening, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>9 to 10 tart apples such as Granny Smith or McIntosh (about 4 lb. total), peeled and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Dash of kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preparing the Crust step 1:</strong></li>

                <p>Using your fingers, mix together flour, butter, and salt in a large bowl until butter is well incorporated. Gradually sprinkle 2 to 4 tablespoons very cold water into mixture, kneading as you add water, until dough just comes together. (You may not need to add all the water.) Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; knead until it forms a smooth ball, 2 to 3 times. Divide dough in half, and shape into 2 disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap; chill at least 2 hours or up to overnight.</p>
                
                <li>Prepare the Crust Step 2:</li>

                <p>Unwrap 1 chilled dough disk, and place on a lightly floured work surface. Let stand at room temperature until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with flour; roll into a 12-inch circle. Carefully fit dough round into a 9-inch deep-dish glass pie plate, leaving a 1 ½-inch overhang around edges. Refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
               
                <li><strong>Preparing the filling step 1:</strong></li>

                <p>Preheat oven to 425°F with oven rack in lowest position. Stir together apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl until apples are evenly coated. Spoon mixture into prepared piecrust; sprinkle mixture with butter.</p>
                
                <li>Preparing the filling step 2:</li>

                <p>Unwrap remaining chilled pie dough disk, and place on a lightly floured work surface. Let stand at room temperature until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with flour; roll into a 12-inch circle. Cut into 12 (¾-inch-wide) strips. (Discard remaining dough scraps, or use for another purpose.) Arrange strips in a lattice design over Filling; trim strips as needed to meet the bottom Crust overhang. Fold dough edges under, and crimp using your fingers or a fork.</p>
                
                <li>Preparing the filling step 3</li>

                <p>Place assembled pie on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F (leaving pie in oven); continue baking 45 minutes. Cover loosely with aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning; continue baking until juices are thick and bubbly, crust is golden brown, and apples are tender when pierced with a long wooden pick, about 30 minutes. Transfer pie to a wire rack, and cool at least 1 hour.</p>
